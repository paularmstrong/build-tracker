# Problem

Explain the problem that this pull request aims to resolve.

# Solution

<!--
When trying to solve more solutions with Build Tracker, please keep in mind some of the following goals of the project:
* Be lightweight: small package sizes (single-digit KiBs, gzipped)
* Be easy: too many options in an API can become confusing
* Be clear: the intended purpose of every method should be as obvious as possible
* Is it easy to do this in "userland"? Would it be better off done there?
-->

Explain your approach. Sometimes it helps to justify your approach against some others that you didn't choose to explain why yours is better.

# TODO

- [ ] 🤓 Add & update tests (always try to _increase_ test coverage)
- [ ] 🔬 Ensure CI is passing (`yarn lint:ci`, `yarn test`, `yarn tsc:ci`)
- [ ] 📖 Update relevant documentation
